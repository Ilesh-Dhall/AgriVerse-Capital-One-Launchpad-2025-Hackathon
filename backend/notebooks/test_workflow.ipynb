The weather data (28Â°C, 15mm rainfall, 65% humidity) indicates moderately warm conditions with some rainfall.  However,  we need the following information to give precise irrigation recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Specific Crop Stage:**  The report mentions soybean and wheat, but at what growth stage are these crops? Irrigation needs vary drastically depending on the growth stage (e.g., seedling, flowering, grain filling).\n",
      "* **Soil Type:** Soil type significantly impacts water holding capacity. Sandy soils need more frequent but lighter irrigation than clay soils.\n",
      "* **Crop Water Requirements:**  The report mentions water productivity and split applications but doesn't provide the actual water requirements (e.g., in mm or inches) for soybean and wheat at different growth stages in Punjab's climate.\n",
      "* **Existing Soil Moisture:**  The 15mm of rainfall is helpful, but we don't know the pre-existing soil moisture level. A simple soil moisture test would be crucial.\n",
      "* **Irrigation Method:** The report mentions drip irrigation, but what method is actually being used (drip, furrow, sprinkler)? This will influence the application rate and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therefore, I cannot provide specific irrigation recommendations (1-4) without this missing information.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Guidelines (Until more data is available):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Assess Soil Moisture:**  Before making any irrigation decision, check the soil moisture at the root zone. A simple method is to dig a small hole and check the moisture level.\n",
      "* **Monitor Crop Appearance:**  Observe the crops for signs of water stress (wilting, leaf rolling).\n",
      "* **Use the 15mm Rainfall:**  The recent rainfall should reduce the immediate need for irrigation, but it's likely not enough for the entire growth cycle.\n",
      "* **Consult Local Experts:**  Contact local agricultural extension services or experienced farmers in Punjab for advice tailored to the specific crops, soil type, and current conditions. They will have the most accurate information on water requirements for the region.\n",
